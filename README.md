* Bluetooth classic and BLE supported by ESP-IDF using bluedroid: [docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/bluetooth/index.html). Bluetooth Classic is required for the game controller.
* NimBLE only supports BLE (vibrators, glasses)
* Using [Rust ESP-IDF template](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-template) should offer everything ESP-IDF exposes, with C and Rust mixed
